# UI Toolkit

Unity's UI Toolkit is a collection of features, functionality, resources and tools for developing user interface (UI). You can use UI Toolkit to develop custom UI and extensions for the Unity Editor, runtime debugging tools, and runtime UI for games and applications.

UI Toolkit is based on, and inspired by, standard web technologies. If you have experience developing web pages or applications, much of your knowledge might be transferable, and many of the core concepts might be familliar.

For more information, see the UI Toolkit Overview below.

> **NOTE**
>
> Although Unity recommends using UI Toolkit for some new UI development projects, it is still missing features found in Unity UI (uGUI) and IMGUI.
>
> These older systems are more appropricate for certain use cases, and are required to support legacy projects. For information about when it is appropriate to choose and older system instead of thie UI Toolkit, see the Comparison of UI systems in Unity.
